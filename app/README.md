# BatteryHub 0.0.1v

## Project Description
This GitHub repository contains a web application built on Flask, designed to facilitate the sorting and inventorying of batteries. The app offers various features to streamline battery management:

+ **Battery Addition:** Users can easily add new battery information to the system, including details like battery type, capacity, and manufacturer.

+ **Record Deletion:** The app provides a functionality to remove battery records, allowing users to maintain an up-to-date and accurate inventory.

+ **Battery Sorting:** With the sorting feature, users can arrange batteries based on specific parameters such as type, capacity, or manufacturer. This enables efficient searching and organization of battery inventory.

+ **Inventory Management:** The app assists in the inventorying process, providing a centralized platform to store and retrieve battery information. It simplifies the task of keeping track of available batteries, ensuring efficient utilization and effective planning.

### Technologies Used
+ **Flask**: A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
+ **API Integration**: The app integrates with external systems or data sources through APIs, enabling seamless communication and data exchange. The API used in this project is a custom-built solution specifically tailored for battery management. The code and implementation details of the API can be found within the following GitHub repository: [BatteryHubAPI](https://github.com/RuslanZaliznyak/BatteryHubAPI).

Please feel free to explore the repository for more information on the custom API implementation.
